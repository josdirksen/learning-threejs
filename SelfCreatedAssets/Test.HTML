/*
Without looking at notes, books, old code, or the web, create a simple THREE.js program that displays a blue sphere with black background. Light your sphere so that it can be seen, but there's no reason to spend time trying to make it more attractive. If I can see it, you have full credit!

You can earn 5% of the total value of this problem just by making sure the path to the three.js library file is "libs/three.js".

When you submit this file, the 2nd part of the exam will become available.
